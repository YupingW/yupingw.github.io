I am a Systems Engineering PhD student at Boston University, advised by [Prof. Gianluca Stringhini](https://seclab.bu.edu/people/gianluca/index.html). I am also a member of [SeclabBU](https://seclab.bu.edu/) and [iDramaLab](https://idrama.science/). 

My current research focuses on applying data-driven approaches to investigate how misinformation spreads over Web communities, e.g., Twitter, Reddit, 4chan, and Gab. In particular, we build computational pipelines by leveraging quantitative methods (machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, statistical inference) to measure the effects of misinformation. Thus, our research helps people better understand the misinformation propagation and provides bases on how to mitigate the malicious impact.

Fauxtography on Web communities
-------
This project investigated fauxtography (images manipulated to spread misinformation) shared on Web communities (Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan). We found that posts containing fauxtography significantly increases users' engagements (e.g., #likes,#retweets). We also found that fauxtography are typically shared as memes.

News stories on Web communities
-------
This project studied on news stories shared on Web communities (Twitter, Reddit, Gab, and 4chan). We characterized users' preference on these Web communities, and analyzed mutual influences between these online communities by using Hawkes Processes.
