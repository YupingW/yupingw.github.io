excerpt: 'This paper investigates the controllability of first-order dynamic-edge multi-agent (DEMA) systems that have dynamic systems attached on not only nodes but also edges. New results include a strong relationship between the controllability of homogeneous-edge DEMA systems and that of induced multi-agent systems (MASs) and a necessary and sufficient condition for the controllability of the general heterogeneous-edge DEMA systems. In addition, for the heterogeneous-edge DEMA systems, two types of special graphs, i.e., the cycle graph and star graph, are further addressed. Finally, one simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness of our results.'

In addition, for the heterogeneous-edge DEMA systems, two types of special graphs, i.e., the cycle graph and star graph, are further addressed. Finally, one simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness of our results.
